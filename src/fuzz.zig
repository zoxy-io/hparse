//! Fuzzing harness for hparse (issue #2).
//!
//! Run modes:
//! * `zig build fuzz` — replays the seed corpus through the oracles once (regression mode).
//! * `zig build fuzz --fuzz` — coverage-guided fuzzing via Zig's native fuzzer.
//!
//! The parser walks the buffer with `[*]const u8` many-item pointers, which Zig's bounds
//! checking does not cover — a 1-byte overread past the slice does not crash and silently
//! reads adjacent memory. A naive "call it and see if it faults" harness would never catch
//! that class. The first two oracles below make it visible; the third is about the
//! tiers agreeing with each other rather than about memory:
//!
//! 1. Guard-page-backed input: every parse runs on a copy whose last byte abuts a
//!    PROT_NONE page, so any read past the end is an immediate SIGSEGV.
//! 2. Prefix/consumed-length exactness: a successful parse consuming N bytes must
//!    reproduce byte-identical results when re-parsing exactly those N bytes, and every
//!    strict prefix of them must return `error.Incomplete` — never a false accept, and
//!    never `error.Invalid` (which would mean the SIMD and scalar matcher tiers, selected
//!    by remaining buffer length, disagree about the same bytes).
//! 3. Path differential: a second build of the parser with the `@Vector` tier forced
//!    off (`-Duse-vectors=false`) parses the same bytes, and must accept or refuse
//!    identically — the tiers disagreeing is what oracle 2 can only catch when the
//!    disagreement happens to fall across a truncation boundary.
//! 4. Reference differential against picohttpparser and llhttp: where hparse and a
//!    reference BOTH accept, the fields must match. Only where both accept — they
//!    disagree about what is legal by design. Two references rather than one because
//!    they are wrong differently: picohttpparser is hand-written and block-oriented,
//!    llhttp is a generated state machine walking one byte at a time.
//! 5. Disagreement snapshot: everywhere oracle 4 skips — a verdict difference rather
//!    than a field difference — is recorded in `disagreements.zig` with a required
//!    justification, and the set is re-derived and diffed on every run. That is the
//!    half of oracle 4 that used to go nowhere: this comment called such cases
//!    "triage material, not failures" while nothing triaged them, which is how a
//!    header key accepting 144 non-tchar bytes survived eight months with
//!    picohttpparser rejecting the very same input in the very same run.
